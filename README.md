# CivCrossbow
Crossbow designed for Civ servers. Revolutionizing Civ warfares.

CivCrossbow is a spigot/bukkit/paper plugin for Civ servers (CivMC and other Civ servers). It is designed to mimic like a gun - except - it uses crossbow and firework rocket in minecraft way. It does not require texture pack or resource pack in order to use this plugin.

The goal in this plugin is to open Civ combat to more people and does not require a lot of practices unlike swordfights. This will encourage more people to take up arm and defend their home lands from raiders and invaders without being worried of getting screwed over due to the skill gap in the swordfighting. No more fighting same people in every conflicts again!
